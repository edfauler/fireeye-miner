# fireeye-miner
MineMeld Miner for Fireeye's urllist implemented as an extension.

## How it works

This simple Miner periodically checks the FireEye urllist.txt also known as FireEye/Bluecoat Integration for new malicious and/or callback URLs and
extract those.


## PreConfiguration using a single FireEye NX

If there is only a standalone FireEye NX open the Fireeye CLI and enter the following commands:

'''
 FireEye-NX > ena
 FireEye-NX # conf t
 FireEye-NX(config) # swg scan enable
 FireEye-NX(config) # swg scan period callback-url past 168 hours
 FireEye-NX(config) # swg scan period malicious-url past 24 hours
 FireEye-NX(config) # wr mem
 Saving configuration file ... Done!
 FireEye-NX(config) #
'''
After SWG scan is enabled check if http://<FQDN of your Fireeye NX/urllist.txt is available.

## PreConfiguration using FireEye CMS

In case there a multiple FireEye NX appliances. Enable SWG scan as explained above on every Fireeye NX and then perform the same steps on the CMS as well.
'''
 FireEye-CMS > ena
 FireEye-CMS # conf t
 FireEye-CMS(config) # swg scan enable
 FireEye-CMS(config) # wr mem
 Saving configuration file ... Done!
 FireEye-CMS(config) #
'''

After SWG scan is enabled check if http://<FQDN of your Fireeye CMS/urllist.txt is available
